About the AvailableLaterObject library

  ${project.description}

  This library allows asynchronous method invocation, i.e. the result may not be available
immediatly.

  In a normal blocking call, you can either 
    [[a]] wait for the result or <br/>
    [[b]] spawn a thread, do the call, and get notified when the thread finishes.

  AvailableLaterObjects turn this around by making (b) the default. The result of a call is a AvailableLaterObject, which you can listen to (get notified) for a result.

  Making this the default behaviour simplifies writing threaded applications, such as GUIs.

* Example

  See the {{source code of AvailableLaterObjectExample{https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/availablelater/blob/master/src/test/java/com/jakeapp/availablelater/AvailableLaterObjectExample.java}}}

* Discussion

  If you want to have the blocking behaviour, you simply create an AvailableLaterWaiter, which blocks until the result of the operation is available.

  Contrary to Futures, AvailableLaterObjects leave it to the callee to spawn and run the thread, or to decide if a result is instantaneously available (no thread spawn necessary, AvailableNowObject).

  Finally, AvailableLaterObjects also allow the task to provides simple notifications on its progress.
