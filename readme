About AvailableLater
=========================

This library allows asynchronous method invocation, i.e. the result may not be available
immediatly.

The calling function receives a AvailableLaterObject, and can await the result.
The callee can decide whether to spawn a Thread or whether a error occured (Exceptions
are passed on transparently) or whether the result is available immediatly.


Why not use Future or FutureTask?
----------------------------------
They do something differently. Futures are meant to give the receiver of the Future
to control the execution.

AvailableLater on the other hand, allows the callee to spawn a thread and give back
a result. The spawning of the thread is transparent and the interface is the same 
when no thread is necessary.
